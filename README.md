Ahmed — AI & Machine Learning Developer

I am a 3rd-year Information Science & Engineering student with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I enjoy building real-world projects involving deep learning, LLM fine-tuning, and embedded systems using Raspberry Pi.

Skills:

Programming: Python, Java, C, C++<br>
AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch (beginner), CNNs, Transformers<br>
Data Science: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib<br> 
Computer Vision: OpenCV, image preprocessing, detection pipelines<br>
Embedded Systems: Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, Flask, API-based pipelines<br>
Other: Git, Linux basics, model deployment concepts,UiPath Automation<br>

Major Projects:

1. Astronomical Event Detection System

    Raspberry Pi Zero 2W + Python-based system for detecting meteor trails, star patterns, and satellite transits using deep learning.

2. Facial Expression Detection (FER-2013)

    TensorFlow-based model using EfficientNetB0 for 7-class emotion classification. Includes training pipeline and inference setup.

3. IoT Server Monitoring System

    Arduino-based monitoring system built in 2nd semester for basic IoT and hardware understanding.

4. LLM Fine-Tuning Project (IonIdea Internship)

    Worked on fine-tuning LLaMA models, dataset preparation, training pipelines, and evaluation frameworks.

What I’m Currently Learning:

  LLM fine-tuning and optimization  
  Advanced CNN architectures  
  Model deployment on cloud and edge devices  
  Improving documentation and code quality in ML projects
